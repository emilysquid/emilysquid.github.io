Sorting algorithms can be a little tough if you only have a couple weeks of computer science experience.  I think they got it by playing this game.  We had a timer and we'd tell them the name of the sorting algorithm and they had to sort each other correctly and before time ran out.  Although there may have been some yelling from the rest of the class.
