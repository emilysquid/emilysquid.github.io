This was my first WebGL project, but once I learned more, I made the jump to 3D, made my own fog and lighting, and set up camera controls.

I wanted this to be really easy to set up on any computer.  I packaged it into a chrome app and Involt checks all the USB ports so it's not speicific to my laptop.  It's as simple as clicking the app, and plugging in the Arduino.
