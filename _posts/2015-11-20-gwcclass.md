The insane statistics on the Girls Who Code site was more than enough to motivate me to join the team. On a personal level, I was the only and the first woman to get my degree at my school. My classmates were supportive, but it's still a bit isolating and I'd love to see that change. I was jumping up and down when I got the opportunity to work for such an amazing organization. Teaching this class was one of the best experiences of my life. I'm so happy that Girls Who Code exists, the world needs it. Our class was hosted by General Electric and we had a spectacular view of Chicago's downtown from our classroom. The girls started out drawing a little square in Scratch, to making robots dance around, to creating art and animations, to coding websites, using APIs and databases, learning encryption and high­level algorithms, and creating your incredible projects. They learned all of this in less than 7 weeks and at times some of them literally laid on the floor, but always got back up, debugged, and high­fived their teams. I couldn't believe how intelligent and dedicated these girls are.  We all grew so close and have way too many inside jokes. These girls are amazing computer scientists and miss them all.
