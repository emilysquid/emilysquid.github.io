I started out messing around with arduino.  I got an accelerometer hooked up, a photo cell, some LEDs, but now I'm just back to the photo cell.  

Here's the old set up. It's a little janky looking.


When I got to the point that I wanted some kind of feedback on the screen, I had an urge to get the Arduino to communicate with WebGL.  I couldn't find much online at the time. I think I found just one project someone had done.  I did manage to find this cool js app called &lt;a href="http://www.google.com"&gt;Involt&lt;/a&gt; It bridged the gap between Arduino and HTML.  From there I opened up a canvas and put in my WebGL.

It started out really simple looking.

This was my first WebGL project, but once I learned more, I made the jump to 3D, made my own fog and lighting, and set up camera controls.

I wanted this to be really easy to set up.  I packaged it into a chrome app and Involt checked all the USB ports.  It's as simple as clicking the app, and plugging in the Arduino.
I even made this little icon for the app.

I also had a little fun with it and put it in an ornate box.  When the box the is open and light is shown, the 3D particles rapidly change direction and color in unison.  I wanted it to look glitchy.  I'll put a video here soon.
