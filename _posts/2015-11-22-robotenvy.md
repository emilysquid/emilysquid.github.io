I definitely worked on this WordPress site the most extensively.  I made a child theme, added numerous widget spaces, edited PHP functions, used the Twitter API to pull in their feed, changed some of the structure of the theme, and other miscellaneous things.  I learned so much helping out &lt;a target=_blank href=http://robot-envy.com&gt;Robot Envy&lt;/a&gt;.  They feature tons of amazing artists and have two successful Kickstarters. Plus, they are some of the coolest people I know.
