I started out messing around with arduino.  I got an accelerometer hooked up, a photo cell, some LEDs, but now I'm just back to the photo cell.  

In this phase, the LEDs changed brightness based on the two sensors. I wanted to swap the LED out for some graphical feedback instead. 

This was my first WebGL project, but once I learned more, I made the jump to 3D, made my own fog and lighting, and set up camera controls.

I wanted this to be really easy to set up.  I packaged it into a chrome app and Involt checked all the USB ports.  It's as simple as clicking the app, and plugging in the Arduino.
I even made this little icon for the app.

I also had a little fun with it and put it in an ornate box.  When the box the is open and light is shown, the 3D particles rapidly change direction and color in unison.  I wanted it to look glitchy.  I'll put a video here soon.
