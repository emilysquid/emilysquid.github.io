When I got to the point that I wanted some kind of feedback on the screen, I had an urge to get the Arduino to communicate with WebGL (because I love WebGL).  I couldn't find much online at the time. I think I found just one project someone had done.  I did manage to find this cool js app called &lt;a target=_blank href=http://involt.github.io&gt;Involt&lt;/a&gt;. It bridged the gap between Arduino and HTML.  From there I opened up a canvas and put in my WebGL.

It started out really simple looking.
